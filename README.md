# isochrones with dynamic layers

This project is to modify the isochrone generator demo built with mapbox gl js and d.js. Some new styling to fit our needs and the addition of buttons to turn layers and poi on and off the map at the end-users choice.

Basically a way to mash up a few examples from GL JS for practice and possible development.
